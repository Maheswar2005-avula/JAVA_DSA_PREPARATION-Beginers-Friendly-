This repository represents my personal learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.  
I created this repository to practice coding daily, improve my logical thinking, and build strong problem-solving skills.

My main goal is to gain clear understanding of core concepts such as arrays, strings, and the Java Collections Framework through consistent hands-on practice.

This repository also reflects my discipline and commitment toward technical interview preparation and continuous self-improvement as a software engineering aspirant.
